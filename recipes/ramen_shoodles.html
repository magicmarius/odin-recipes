        <p>In this daring take on the classic Ramen noodles dish, we add some flavour that</p>
        <p>you simply can't find anywhere else but in an already worn shoe.</p>
        <p>Be sure to use a really old shoe, so that you can avoid that new shoe taste.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An old shoe (you can find these at just about any dump)</li>
            <li>Two packets of Ramen Noodles (just steal some from your local shop)</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the packet of Ramen and break the contents into the shoe.</li>
            <li>Add the water to a kettle and boil.</li>
            <li>Pour the water into the shoe.</li>
            <li>Wait three minutes to let it really soak in.</li>
            <li>Eat that shit right out of the shoe you fucking animal.</li>
        </ol>
